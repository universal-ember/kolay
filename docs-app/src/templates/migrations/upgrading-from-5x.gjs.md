# Upgrading from 5.x

The plugin API was reworked for composability ([#323](https://github.com/universal-ember/kolay/issues/323)). This page covers every breaking change.

## `kolay()` is split into `docs()` + `apiDocs()`

The combined plugin is gone. Markdown docs and api docs are configured separately:

```diff
- import { kolay } from "kolay/vite";
+ import { docs, apiDocs } from "kolay/vite";

  export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [
-     kolay({
-       groups: [{ name: "Docs", src: import.meta.resolve("./docs") }],
-       packages: ["my-library"],
-       scope: `...`,
-     }),
+     docs("Docs", {
+       src: import.meta.resolve("./docs"),
+       scope: `...`,
+     }),
+     apiDocs(["my-library"]),
    ],
  });
```

(`typedoc()` was a brief intermediate name for `apiDocs()` — if you're on a 5.5+ version that had it, it's the same rename.)

`kolay/webpack` is gone with it — the plugins are Vite-only.

## `docs()` takes `(groupName, options)` — one usage per group

The `groups: []` array is gone. Call `docs()` once per group:

```diff
- docs({
-   groups: [
-     { name: "guides", src: import.meta.resolve("./guides") },
-     { name: "api", src: import.meta.resolve("./api-docs") },
-   ],
- }),
+ docs("guides", { src: import.meta.resolve("./guides") }),
+ docs("api", { src: import.meta.resolve("./api-docs") }),
```

When the first argument is a path or URL, its last segment becomes the group name (and it serves as the `src`):

```js
docs(import.meta.resolve("./guides")); // group: "guides"
```

With no arguments, only the co-located pages (`app/templates`, `src/templates`) are served. Each usage's markdown options (`remarkPlugins`, `rehypePlugins`, `scope`) apply to that group's `.gjs.md` files only.

## `apiDocs()` takes an array of strings

No options object, and the `dest` option is gone (JSON always lives under `docs/`):

```diff
- typedoc({ packages: ["my-library"], dest: "api" }),
+ apiDocs(["my-library", "./packages/my-other-library"]),
```

Entries are validated when the config loads: package names must be installed, relative paths must exist, and paths _within_ packages are rejected (entry points come from `package.json#exports`).

## Routing: per-group virtual modules

The primary way to mount a group's routes is now its virtual module:

```diff
- import { addRoutes } from "kolay";
+ import { addRoutes as addGuidesRoutes } from "virtual:kolay/docs/guides";

  Router.map(function () {
-   addRoutes(this);
+   this.route("guides", function () {
+     addGuidesRoutes(this);
+   });
  });
```

The top-level `addRoutes(this)` is now optional — it serves the co-located pages (and any group named by the URL) from the root URL space, so keep it if you have `app/templates` pages or want 5.x-style URLs. An app can also mount only its groups' routes and keep the root for itself. Per-group mounts unlock per-group route templates (and with them, [per-group designs](/development/configuring-docs.md)).

## `kolay/compiled-docs:virtual` is now the metamanifest

If you imported it directly (rather than through `setupKolay()`), its shape changed — it lists the groups and how to load each group's module, instead of carrying one combined manifest:

```diff
- const { manifest, pages } = await import("kolay/compiled-docs:virtual");
+ import { loadCompiledDocs } from "kolay";
+
+ const meta = await import("kolay/compiled-docs:virtual");
+ const { manifest, pages } = await loadCompiledDocs(meta);
```

`setupKolay()` and `setupKolay` from `kolay/test-support` do this for you (loading every group in parallel).

## `PageTree` is now `PageTree`

A node in a page tree — the thing built from a directory of markdown files — was called a `PageTree`. It is now a **`PageTree`**, so that "collection" is free to mean something else, and because that is what the docs already called these ("Sorting folders", and the utils page's own examples).

The type, the type guard, and `<PageNav />`'s named block all move together. The block is the one that will break a build:

```diff
  <PageNav>
    <:page as |x|>
      <x.Link>{{x.page.name}}</x.Link>
    </:page>
-   <:collection as |x|>
+   <:pageTree as |x|>
      {{#if x.index}}
-       <x.index.Link>{{x.collection.name}}</x.index.Link>
+       <x.index.Link>{{x.pageTree.name}}</x.index.Link>
      {{else}}
-       {{x.collection.name}}
+       {{x.pageTree.name}}
      {{/if}}
-   </:collection>
+   </:pageTree>
  </PageNav>
```

```diff
- import { isPageTree } from 'kolay';
- import type { PageTree } from 'kolay';
+ import { isPageTree } from 'kolay';
+ import type { PageTree } from 'kolay';

- if (isPageTree(node)) { … }
+ if (isPageTree(node)) { … }
```

`getIndexPage` keeps its name (it takes a `PageTree` now), and `Node` is `Page | PageTree`. The `Runtime/utilities/collection-utils` page is now `page-tree-utils`, with a redirect from the old URL.

## Removed types

`Options`, `MarkdownPagesOptions`, and `APIDocsOptions` (from `kolay/build` / `kolay/types`) described the old options shapes and are gone. `kolay/build` exports `DocsOptions` instead.
